# CHEATSHEET FOR DEVELOPERS

There are an ever-increasing number of languages and tools in which a developer needs to know and it is simply impossible to memorize all the different commands and syntaxes. This is born out of that struggles and growing pains. It meant to be an open-source when everyone is encouraged to contribute and add into this as you see fit. Happy coding!
